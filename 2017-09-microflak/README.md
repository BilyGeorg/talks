# Things talked about
There are a lot of great presentations for [Pycon 2016](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwTD5zJbsQGJN75MwbykYNw) and [Pycon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg). Here are a couple that piqued my interest.
## Microflak
Microservices are receiving the buzzword treatment these days, and as such, they have a cloud of hype surrounding them that makes it hard to separate substance from fluff. In this tutorial, Miguel Grinberg starts with an introduction to this architecture, including what's great and not so great about it, and then teaches you how a traditional monolithic application written in Flask can be refactored into a modern distributed system based on microservices.

## Magic-Wormhole
""magic-wormhole"" is a simple tool to move files from one computer to another, like ""scp"" but without the setup. By telling the recipient just a few secret words, the file is safely encrypted and delivered directly to the correct machine. The talk will explain the security mechanics, the cryptography (NaCl and SPAKE2), and how to use the underlying open-source library in your own applications.
